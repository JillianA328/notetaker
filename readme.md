Thie app is a note taker app.  The user can write/save notes.  I used express.js, json, bootstrap css, html, and javescript to create the app.  I did get help from a tutor and a TA was helping a lot of us in class.  I attempted the "delete" function, but was unable to get it to work...  I will keep working on it though!
